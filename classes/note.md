PRIVATE AND PROTECTED MEMBERS
Private modifiers allows members to be accessed within the class but restricts members from being accessed outside
objects instantiated by a class can't use its private members

Protected modifiers is does the same except that this kind of members are or can be inherited.

NOTE: Careful using these two modifiers because they can cause cobbling.
